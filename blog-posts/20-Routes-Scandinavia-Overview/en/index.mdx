The best thing about planning a bike ride is the moment when you discover a new route and imagine yourself pedaling all those kilometers through the countryside, breathing the fresh air and experiencing it yourself, right? This is exactly what we did when we researched all **long-distance cycling routes in Norway, Sweden and Finland**. So exciting that we wanted to start our bike tour right away! In this article you will find all routes in Scandinavia, key facts and GPX files to download. Now all you have to do is choose your cycling holiday.

## Cycling in Scandinavia

Scandinavia, that is Norway, Sweden and Finland. They have a lot in common, but there are things they don't.

### White Nights and Northern Lights

A phenomenon which is common to all 3 countries is the summer of white nights. Depending on how far north you go, you can **cycle almost until midnight**. Already in September, on the other hand, days get shorter and you can see the **Northern Lights**. Tip: The area around 70 degree north is best for spotting northern lights, the Lofoten on the Coastal Route in Norway, or Rovaniemi on the EuroVelo 11 through Finland, for example. But you can also be lucky elsewhere to see the green glow in the sky.

### Mosquitoes at the Lake

Another common phenomenon Scandinavia is famous for are mosquitoes. The beasts have high season from June. They disappear with the first frost, sometime in September. While cycling, they don't bother you. But as soon as you settle down comfortably on the shore of one of the countless idyllic lakes, you should be prepared: a mosquito net for your head and mosquito-proof clothing. Fortunately, the evening hours are so cool that you would wear the clothes anyway. The spectacular views and vast, lonely landscapes will make up for the effort. Don't let a few mosquitoes spoil your cycling holiday.

### Rain on Cycling Vacation

We're not sugarcoating it: Vacation in Scandinavia without rain is extremely unlikely. Cycling in the sunshine is great, but with the **right rain gear** and a suitable tent, you can keep up the holiday spirit even when the weather is bad for a couple of days. That's how it's done: Accept the rain. Especially in Sweden and Finland, the landscape looks beautiful even in the rain, or then the most! The raindrops sparkle on moss and lichen and the green of the forests almost leaps at you.

Rain gear: There is no such thing as 100% waterproof rainwear. It just delays getting wet. At some point the water runs into the collar, into the sleeves, from the jacket into the trousers, from the trousers into the shoes. You could ride until you feel your clothes under the raingear get wet and then shelter or set up your tent. If you get completely wet, you should keep going until you come to a place where you can dry yourself.

Rainwear only makes sense when it's cold enough. Otherwise, you sweat under your clothes as if you had cycled without them. In Scandinavia it is cold when it rains. Especially in Norway where the rain goes with wind. Sturdy, really waterproof rain gear is worth it here. That your raingear is light and breathable is secondary if you want to keep up your holiday spirit.

Your **tent** should be suitable for rain. Practical is an anteroom, where you can cook and sit out the rain for a few hours. **Tunnel tents** usually offer large anterooms. They also have the advantage that you **can dismantle the inner tent individually**. That way it stays dry. So the next time you set it up, you put your mat in a dry inner tent. Sounds good, right?

### Mountains

Let's get to the differences. The mountains are very unevenly distributed in Scandinavia. The Scandinavian Mountains run all the way through Norway. The whole country is one big mountain range. In addition, the coast is rugged by countless fjords. In Norway you will make a lot of climbs and many kilometers in east-west direction to advance far less kilometers north to south. You will be compensated with the most breathtaking views in the world (my opinion).

Avoid detours by carefully planning your cycle route through Norway. At weonbikes.com you can download GPX files for all routes for your planning. If you want to be sure your route is feasible, [Matthew from Cycle Norway](https://www.cyclenorway.com/services) will help you personally with route planning in Norway.

In contrast to Norway, in Sweden and Finland you can just start cycling with a rough idea of your direction. In western Sweden there are still mountainous areas. Eastern Sweden and Finland are completely flat. Ideal for cycling with luggage.

### Tunnels

Speaking of detours. There are thousands of tunnels in Norway. Many of these tunnels are closed to cyclists. You should get information about it in advance. This is, because there is not always an alternative, which brings us back to detours. In Norway you should plan your route well in advance. Check out our [Norway article with interactive map](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/) and this [website with tunnels in Norway for cyclists](https://www.cycletourer.co.uk/maps/tunnelmap.shtml).
